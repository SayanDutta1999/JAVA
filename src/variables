Java Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false




Integer Types
Byte
The byte data type can store whole numbers from -128 to 127. This can be used instead 
of int or other integer types to save memory when you are certain that the value will be within -128 and 127:



Short
The short data type can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767:


Int
The int data type can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647. In general, and in our tutorial, 
the int data type is the preferred data type when we create variables with a numeric value.
